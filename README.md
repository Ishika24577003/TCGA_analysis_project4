# TCGA_analysis_project4
Rule all:
Purpose: This rule specifies the final output files that the workflow aims to produce. It ensures that the workflow runs until all specified files are generated.
Output:results/expression_summary.tsv: A summary of gene expression values.
      results/sample_metadata.tsv: Metadata associated with the samples.
      results/expression_plot.png: A plot visualizing the expression data (not defined in the provided code, but mentioned in the final output).
Rule ExtractGeneExpressionData:
Input: A tar.gz file containing the raw gene expression data.
Output: A directory (results/extracted_data/) where the extracted files will be stored.
Logic:This rule extracts the contents of the tar.gz file using Python's tarfile module.
      The extracted files will be used in subsequent processing steps.

Rule ProcessGeneExpression:
Input: All TSV files extracted in the previous step (using glob_wildcards to match file patterns).
Output: A single summary file (results/expression_summary.tsv) containing sample names and expression values for a specific gene.
Logic:
The rule reads each TSV file and extracts the expression value for a specified gene (e.g., "GENE_Y").
It assumes that the gene expression data is structured such that the gene names are in the second column and the expression values (TPM) are in the seventh column.
The results are written to the summary file with a header row.

Rule CreateSampleMetadata:
Input:The expression summary file generated in the previous rule.
A sample sheet file (gdc_sample_sheet.2024-09-27.tsv) containing metadata about the samples.
Output: A metadata file (results/sample_metadata.tsv).
Logic:This rule reads the expression summary and the sample sheet to create a consolidated metadata file.
It prepares the data for further analysis or visualization, although the specific processing logic for creating the metadata file is not shown in the provided code.

Input:

File: results/sample_metadata.tsv
      This file contains the processed metadata, which likely includes gene expression values and sample classifications (e.g., 'Solid Tissue Normal' and 'Primary Tumor').
Output: File: results/expression_plot.png
        This is the image file that will be generated by the plotting script, containing the boxplot visualization of the gene expression data.
Logic:The rule executes a shell command that runs a Python script named generate_boxplot.py.
      The script takes the input file ({input}) and output file ({output}) as arguments.
      It is responsible for reading the metadata, processing the data as needed, and generating the boxplot based on the expression values
